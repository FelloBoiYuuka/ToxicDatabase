A RAT (Remote Access Trojan) is a type of malware that gains access to the users PC via downloading suspicious files or getting phished.
Once ran, it immediately starts its payloads like keylogging, taking pictures of the desktop or webcam which will be used as blackmail for the attacker, stealing passwords and installing a botnet.

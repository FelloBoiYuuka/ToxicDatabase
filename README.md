# FAQ

1. Q: Why can't I open the archives?
   A: Probably because of the splitted zips. Firstly, download all the files in the folder and then open the **.001** file and then extract it with the password. If not that, the archive is broken, make an issue if so. Thanks.

Got anymore questions? Make an issue if so.

# ðŸ“‹ Rules for people who want to contribute
*Note, if you aren't gonna tribute to this, you can ignore this file*

1. Don't delete stuff without my permission.
   You can delete stuff if you ask my permission, like if there's a malware leak someone wants it to be removed.
2. Don't spam add stuff
   This means after I add you, you can only upload 5 samples a day, only AG, OneFive_Malware, Gabolate, Calibrato and Siobhan can do unlimited file uploads
3. Upload it correctly
   Okay, do if you're planning on joining, you must upload them with the file .7z and the password below, if the archive is too large, then [split](https://youtu.be/mN-xGG2nhQY?si=kCG6HTc5BHKDvA-b) the 7z file and make a new folder in the directory and upload it there. Oh, and make sure to credit the og person if possible. :)
4. I must know you
   I don't feel like making random strangers contribute to this, I **must** know you on Discord or any other social platforms before we can talk about that.
5. Do not open issues for chatting with staff (Use Discussions, please)
6. And that's it.
